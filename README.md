# Bots & Dragons
This will turn into a chatbot, that does some basic story telling for pen and paper RPGs.

We use the Microsoft Botframework and will probably start with a Telegram Bot.
At the moment, the bot is only capable of rolling dices.

To get started with the Botframework follow the instructions under the header "Getting started with .NET" on the following site:
https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/gettingstarted.html

TODO:
- Greet the players.
- Implement a way to handle events - The goal is that it works kinda like a textadventure, but with random events. 
- create events
