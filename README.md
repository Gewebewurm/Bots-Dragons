# Bots & Dragons
This will turn into a chatbot, that does some basic story telling for pen and paper RPGs.

We use the Microsoft Botframework and will probably start with a Telegram Bot.
At the moment, only the basic Bot template is located in the Repo, but this will change.

To get started with the Botframework follow the instructions under the header "Getting started with .NET" on the following site:
